## Implementation Details

### Voice Command System

The voice command system uses a sophisticated pattern matching algorithm to recognize commands in both English and Chinese. It extracts entities like dates, times, and names from the command text and routes the command to the appropriate service for execution.

```javascript
// Example voice command processing
const processCommand = (commandText, language) => {
  // Detect command type
  const commandType = detectCommandType(commandText, language);
  
  // Extract entities
  const entities = extractEntities(commandText, language);
  
  // Execute command
  switch (commandType) {
    case 'CREATE_TASK':
      return taskService.createTask(entities);
    case 'SEND_EMAIL':
      return emailService.composeEmail(entities);
    case 'SCHEDULE_MEETING':
      return meetingService.scheduleMeeting(entities);
    // ...other command types
    default:
      return { success: false, message: 'Command not recognized' };
  }
};
```

### Task Organization

Tasks are stored in a structured format with support for subtasks, attachments, and metadata. The task service provides CRUD operations and filtering capabilities.

```javascript
// Task structure
{
  id: 'task-123',
  title: 'Quarterly Report',
  description: 'Prepare quarterly financial report',
  priority: 'high',
  dueDate: '2025-04-15T14:00:00Z',
  completed: false,
  category: 'work',
  subtasks: [
    { id: 'subtask-1', title: 'Gather data', completed: true },
    { id: 'subtask-2', title: 'Create charts', completed: false }
  ],
  attachments: [
    { id: 'attach-1', name: 'Previous Report.pdf', url: '...' }
  ],
  createdAt: '2025-04-01T10:30:00Z',
  updatedAt: '2025-04-02T15:45:00Z'
}
```

### Email Management

The email service integrates with Superhuman API for enhanced email capabilities while providing a simple interface for the application.

```javascript
// Email composition
const composeEmail = async (options) => {
  try {
    const email = {
      id: generateId(),
      to: options.recipients,
      cc: options.cc || [],
      bcc: options.bcc || [],
      subject: options.subject,
      body: options.body,
      attachments: options.attachments || [],
      draft: options.draft || true,
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    await saveEmailToStore(email);
    
    if (!options.draft) {
      await sendEmail(email);
    }
    
    return { success: true, email };
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error };
  }
};
```

### Meeting Scheduling

The meeting service handles scheduling, participant management, and integration with Google Meet for online meetings.

```javascript
// Meeting scheduling
const scheduleMeeting = async (options) => {
  try {
    const meeting = {
      id: generateId(),
      title: options.title,
      startTime: options.startTime,
      endTime: options.endTime,
      location: options.location,
      isOnline: options.isOnline || false,
      meetLink: options.isOnline ? await createGoogleMeetLink() : null,
      participants: options.participants || [],
      description: options.description || '',
      reminders: options.reminders || [15], // minutes before
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    await saveMeetingToStore(meeting);
    
    if (options.sendInvites) {
      await sendMeetingInvites(meeting);
    }
    
    return { success: true, meeting };
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error };
  }
};
```

### Cross-Device Synchronization

The sync service ensures data consistency across devices with support for offline operations and conflict resolution.

```javascript
// Sync process
const syncData = async () => {
  try {
    // Get last sync timestamp
    const lastSync = await getLastSyncTimestamp();
    
    // Get local changes since last sync
    const localChanges = await getLocalChangesSince(lastSync);
    
    // Get remote changes since last sync
    const remoteChanges = await fetchRemoteChangesSince(lastSync);
    
    // Resolve conflicts
    const { resolvedLocal, resolvedRemote } = resolveConflicts(localChanges, remoteChanges);
    
    // Apply remote changes locally
    await applyChangesLocally(resolvedRemote);
    
    // Push local changes to remote
    await pushChangesToRemote(resolvedLocal);
    
    // Update last sync timestamp
    await updateLastSyncTimestamp();
    
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error };
  }
};
```

## User Interface

The user interface is designed to be intuitive and consistent across both iPhone and Mac platforms, with platform-specific optimizations for the best user experience.
